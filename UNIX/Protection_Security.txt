#These are some of the commands I managed to try- haven't written in record though.

#1. Write a command to display all file types in home/6a directory
ls | xargs file -b | sort | uniq

#2.Add two files to an archive using tar and compress the archive. Reverse process and extract files in their original form
tar -czvf myArch.tar.gz /home/6a/Anisha/O*/commands.txt /home/6a/Anisha/O*/commands2.txt

tar -xzvf myArch.tar.gz 

#3. Implement the cmp comm and diff with 2 files
cmp commands.txt commands2.txt

comm test.txt test2.txt

diff test.txt test2.txt

#4.Display all files in directory based on last accessed time
ls -ltu
